# Objects and Classes

## Objectives
In this reading, you'll learn about:
*	Fundamental concepts of Python objects and classes.
*	Structure of classes and object code.
*	Real-world examples related to objects and classes.

## Introduction to classes and object
Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that uses a paradigm centered around objects and classes.
Let's look at these fundamental concepts.

## Classes
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that its objects will have.
Think of a class as a cookie cutter and objects as the cookies cut from that template.
In Python, you can create classes using the class keyword.### Benefits of using functions

### Creating Classes
When you create a class, you specify the **attributes** (data) and **methods** (functions) that objects of that class will have.

**Attributes** are defined as variables within the class, and **methods** are defined as functions.

For example, you can design a "Car" class with attributes such as "color" and "speed," along with methods like **"accelerate." **

### Objects
An object is a fundamental unit in Python that represents a real-world entity or concept.Objects can be tangible (like a car) or abstract (like a student's grade).

Every object has two main characteristics:

### State
The attributes or data that describe the object. For your "Car" object, this might include attributes like "color", "speed", and "fuel level".

### Behavior
The actions or methods that the object can perform. In Python, methods are functions that belong to objects and can change the object's state or perform specific operations.

### Instantiating objects
*	Once you've defined a class, you can create individual objects (instances) based on that class.
*	Each object is independent and has its own set of attributes and methods.
*	To create an object, you use the class name followed by parentheses, so: "my_car = Car()"

### Interacting with objects
You interact with objects by calling their methods or accessing their attributes using dot notation.

For example, if you have a Car object named **my_car**, you can set its color with **my_car.color = "blue"** and accelerate it with **my_car.accelerate()** if there's an accelerate method defined in the class.

## Structure of classes and object code
Please don't directly copy and use this code because it is a template for explanation and not for specific results.

### Class declaration (class ClassName)
*	The class keyword is used to declare a class in Python.
*	ClassName is the name of the class, typically following CamelCase naming conventions.
	  **class ClassName:**

### Class attributes (class_attribute = value)
*	Class attributes are variables shared among all class instances (objects).
*	They are defined within the class but outside of any methods.

  class ClassName:
      # Class attributes (shared by all instances)
      class_attribute = value

### Constructor method (def init(self, attribute1, attribute2, …):)
*	The **__init__ ** , used doubled underscore on both sides of init, method is a special method known as the constructor.
*	It initializes the **instance attributes** (also called instance variables) when an object is created.
*	The **self** parameter is the first parameter of the constructor, referring to the instance being created.
*	**attribute1, attribute2**, and so on are parameters passed to the constructor when creating an object.
*	Inside the constructor, **self.attribute1, self.attribute2**, and so on are used to assign values to instance attributes.
    
    class ClassName:
        # Class attributes (shared by all instances)
        class_attribute = value
    
        # Constructor method (initialize instance attributes)
        def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2, ...):
            pass
            # ...

### Instance attributes (self.attribute1 = attribute1)
*	Instance attributes are variables that store data specific to each class instance.
*	They are initialized within the __init__ method using the self keyword followed by the attribute name.
*	These attributes hold unique data for each object created from the class.

      class ClassName:
          # Class attributes (shared by all instances)
          class_attribute = value
      
          # Constructor method (initialize instance attributes)
          def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2, ...):
              self.attribute1 = attribute1
              self.attribute2 = attribute2
              # ...

### Instance methods (def method1(self, parameter1, parameter2, …):)
*	Instance methods are functions defined within the class.
*	They operate on the instance's data (instance attributes) and can perform actions specific to instances.
*	The **self** parameter is required in instance methods, allowing them to access instance attributes and call other methods within the class.

class ClassName:
    # Class attributes (shared by all instances)
    class_attribute = value

    # Constructor method (initialize instance attributes)
    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2, ...):
        self.attribute1 = attribute1
        self.attribute2 = attribute2
        # ...

  # Instance methods (functions)
      def method1(self, parameter1, parameter2, ...):
          # Method logic
          pass

	Using the same steps you can define multiple instance methods.
        class ClassName:
            # Class attributes (shared by all instances)
            class_attribute = value
        
            # Constructor method (initialize instance attributes)
            def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2, ...):
                self.attribute1 = attribute1
                self.attribute2 = attribute2
                # ...
        
            # Instance methods (functions)
            def method1(self, parameter1, parameter2, ...):
                # Method logic
                pass
        
            def method2(self, parameter1, parameter2, ...):
                # Method logic
                Pass

  **Note:** Now, you have successfully created a dummy class.

### Creating objects (Instances)
*	To create objects (instances) of the class, you call the class like a function and provide arguments the constructor requires.
*	Each object is a distinct instance of the class, with its own instance attributes and the ability to call methods defined in the class.

- Create objects (instances) of the class
object1 = ClassName(arg1, arg2, ...)
object2 = ClassName(arg1, arg2, ...)


### Calling methods on objects
*	In this section, you will call methods on objects, specifically object1 and object2.
*	The methods method1 and method2 are defined in the ClassName class, and you're calling them on object1 and object2 respectively.
*	You pass values param1_value and param2_value as arguments to these methods. These arguments are used within the method's logic.

#### Method 1: Using dot notation
*	This is the most straightforward way to call an object's method. In this, use the dot notation **(object.method())** to invoke the method on the object directly.
*	For example, **result1 = object1.method1(param1_value, param2_value, ...)** calls method1 on object1.

- Calling methods on objects
- Method 1: Using dot notation
        result1 = object1.method1(param1_value, param2_value, ...)
        result2 = object2.method2(param1_value, param2_value, ...)

#### Method 2: Assigning object methods to variables
*	Here's an alternative way to call an object's method by assigning the method reference to a variable.
*	method_reference = object1.method1 assigns the method method1 of object1 to the variable method_reference.
*	Later, call the method using the variable like this: result3 = method_reference(param1_value, param2_value, …).

- Method 2: Assigning object methods to variables
      method_reference = object1.method1  # Assign the method to a variable
      result3 = method_reference(param1_value, param2_value, ...)


### Accessing object attributes
*	Here, you are accessing an object's attribute using dot notation.
*	**attribute_value = object1.attribute1** retrieves the value of the attribute **attribute1** from **object1** and assigns it to the variable **attribute_value**.
  
- Accessing object attributes
      attribute_value = object1.attribute1  # Access the attribute using dot notation

### Modifying object attributes
*	You will modify an object's attribute using dot notation.
*	object1.attribute2 = new_value sets the attribute attribute2 of object1 to the new value new_value.

- Modifying object attributes
    object1.attribute2 = new_value  # Change the value of an attribute using dot notation

### Accessing class attributes (shared by all instances)
*	Finally, access a class attribute shared by all class instances.
*	**class_attr_value = ClassName.class_attribute** accesses the class attribute class_attribute from the ClassName class and assigns its value to the variable class_attr_value.

- Accessing class attributes (shared by all instances)
    class_attr_value = ClassName.class_attribute

### Real-world example
Let's write a python program that simulates a simple car class, allowing you to create car instances, accelerate them, and display their current speeds.
Let's start by defining a **Car** class that includes the following attributes and methods:
*	Class attribute **max_speed,** which is set to **120 km/h**.
*	Constructor method **__init__ ** that takes parameters for the **car's make, model, color, and an optional speed (defaulting to 0)**. This method initializes instance attributes for make, model, color, and speed.
*	Method **accelerate(self, acceleration)** that allows the car to accelerate. If the acceleration does not exceed the **max_speed,** update the **car's speed** attribute. Otherwise, set the speed to the **max_speed**.
*	Method **get_speed(self)** that returns the current speed of the car.

 	        class Car:
            - Class attribute (shared by all instances)
            max_speed = 120  # Maximum speed in km/h
        
            # Constructor method (initialize instance attributes)
            def __init__(self, make, model, color, speed=0):
                self.make = make
                self.model = model
                self.color = color
                self.speed = speed  # Initial speed is set to 0
        
            # Method for accelerating the car
            def accelerate(self, acceleration):
                if self.speed + acceleration <= Car.max_speed:
                    self.speed += acceleration
                else:
                    self.speed = Car.max_speed
        
            # Method to get the current speed of the car
            def get_speed(self):
                return self.speed

Now, you will instantiate two objects of the Car class, each with the following characteristics:
    	car1: **Make = "Toyota", Model = "Camry", Color = "Blue"**
    	car2: **Make = "Honda", Model = "Civic", Color = "Red"**
      
# Create objects (instances) of the Car class
      car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "Blue")
      car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic", "Red")

Using the accelerate method, you will increase the speed of car1 by 30 km/h and car2 by 20 km/h.
# Accelerate the cars
      car1.accelerate(30)
      car2.accelerate(20)

##### Using the accelerate method, you will increase the speed of car1 by 30 km/h and car2 by 20 km/h.

# Print the current speeds of the cars
      print(f"{car1.make} {car1.model} is currently at {car1.get_speed()} km/h.")
      print(f"{car2.make} {car2.model} is currently at {car2.get_speed()} km/h.")

## Next steps
In conclusion, this reading provides a fundamental understanding of objects and classes in Python, essential concepts in object-oriented programming. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating data attributes and methods. Objects represent real-world entities and possess their unique state and behavior. The structured code example presented in the reading outlines the key elements of a class, including class attributes, the constructor method for initializing instance attributes, and instance methods for defining object-specific functionality.
