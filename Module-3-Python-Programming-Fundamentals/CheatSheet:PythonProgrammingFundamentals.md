# Cheat Sheet: Python Programming Fundamentals

Use this cheat sheet for various packages/methods, their descriptions, and examples.

### AND
Returns True if both statement1 and statement2 are True. Otherwise, returns False.

Example: statement1 and statement2 \

Code:
    marks = 90
    attendance_percentage = 87
    
    if marks >= 80 and attendance_percentage >= 85:
        print("qualify for honors")
    else:
        print("Not qualified for honors")
    
    # Output = qualify for honors

### Class Definition
Defines a blueprint for creating objects and defining their attributes and behaviors.

Syntax: class ClassName: # Class attributes and methods 
Code:
  class Person: 
      def __init__(self, name, age): 
          self.name = name 
          self.age = age


### Define Function
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks when called.

Syntax: 
  def function_name(parameters): # Function body 

  def greet(name): print("Hello,", name)

### Equal (==)
Checks if two values are equal.

Syntax: 
  variable1 == variable2 

Code: 5 == 5 
returns True

age = 25 
age == 30 
#returns False


### For Loop
A for loop repeatedly executes a block of code for a specified number of iterations or over a sequence of elements (list, range, string, etc.).

Syntax: 
  for variable in sequence: # Code to repeat 

Code:
  for num in range(1, 10): 
      print(num) 


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"] 
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


### Function Call
A function call is the act of executing the code within the function using the provided arguments.

Syntax: 
  function_name(arguments) 

CodE:
  greet("Alice")


### Greater Than or Equal To(>=)
Checks if the value of variable1 is greater than or equal to variable2.

Syntax: 
  variable1 >= variable2

Code:
  5 >= 5 and 9 >= 5 
  returns True

Example 2:
  quantity = 105 
  minimum = 100 
  quantity >= minimum 
  returns True

### Greater Than(>)
Checks if the value of variable1 is greater than variable2.

Syntax: variable1 > variable2 
9 > 6   #returns True

Example 2:
    age = 20 
    max_age = 25 
    age > max_age 
  #returns False

### If Statement
Executes code block if the condition is True.

Syntax: if condition: #code block for if statement 

Code: 
  if temperature > 30: 
    print("It's a hot day!")

### If-Elif-Else
Executes the first code block if condition1 is True, otherwise checks condition2, and so on. If no condition is True, the else block is executed.

Syntax: 
  if condition1:
  # Code if condition1 is True
  
  elif condition2:
  # Code if condition2 is True
  
  else:
  # Code if no condition is True

Code:
  score = 85  # Example score
  if score >= 90:
      print("You got an A!")
  elif score >= 80:
      print("You got a B.")
  else:
      print("You need to work harder.")
  
  # Output = You got a B.

### If-Else Statement
Executes the first code block if the condition is True, otherwise the second block.

Syntax: 
  if condition: # Code, if condition is True 
  else: # Code, if condition is False 

Code:
  if age >= 18:
      print("You're an adult.")
  else:
      print("You're not an adult yet.")

### Less Than or Equal To(<=)
Checks if the value of variable1 is less than or equal to variable2.

Syntax: variable1 <= variable2 	
Code:
  5 <= 5 and 3 <= 5  #returns True

  size = 38 
  max_size = 40 
  size <= max_size   #returns True

### Less Than(<)
Checks if the value of variable1 is less than variable2.

Syntax: variable1 < variable2
Code: 
  4 < 6 
#returns True

Example 2:
  score = 60 
  passing_score = 65 
  score < passing_score  #returns True

### Loop Controls
break exits the loop prematurely. continue skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

Syntax: 
  for: # Code to repeat 
      if # boolean statement
          break 
  
  for: # Code to repeat  
      if # boolean statement
          continue

Code: Example 1:
  for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        break
    print(num)

#Example 2:
for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)

### NOT
Returns True if variable is False, and vice versa.

Syntax: not variable
Code:
  isLocked = False
  print(not isLocked)
  #returns True if the variable is False (i.e., unlocked).

### Not Equal(!=)	
Checks if two values are not equal.

Syntax: variable1 != variable2 
Code:
  a = 10 
  b = 20 
  a != b  #returns True

#Example 2:
count=0 
count != 0  #returns False

### Object Creation
Creates an instance of a class (object) using the class constructor.

Syntax: object_name = ClassName(arguments) 
Code:
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)

### OR	
Returns True if either statement1 or statement2 (or both) are True. Otherwise, returns False.

Syntax: statement1 or statement2
Code:
  "Farewell Party Invitation" 
  grade = 12 
  if grade == 11 or grade == 12:
      print("Farewell Party Invitation")
  else:
      print("Not eligible") 
#returns True

### range()
Generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range.	

Syntax: 
  range(stop) 
  range(start, stop) 
  range(start, stop, step) 

Code: 
  range(5) #generates a sequence of integers from 0 to 4. 
  range(2, 10) #generates a sequence of integers from 2 to 9. 
  range(1, 11, 2) #generates odd integers from 1 to 9.

### Return Statement
Return is a keyword used to send a value back from a function to its caller.

Syntax: return value 
Code: 
  def add(a, b): return a + b 
    result = add(3, 5)

### Try-Except Block
Tries to execute the code in the try block. If an exception of the specified type occurs, the code in the except block is executed.

Syntax: 
  try: # Code that might raise an exception except 
  ExceptionType: # Code to handle the exception 

Code:
    try: 
      num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
  except ValueError: 
      print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

### Try-Except with Else Block
Code in the else block is executed if no exception occurs in the try block.

Syntax: 
  try: # Code that might raise an exception except 
  ExceptionType: # Code to handle the exception 
  else: # Code to execute if no exception occurs 

Code:
  try: 
    num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
  except ValueError: 
      print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number") 
  else: 
      print("You entered:", num)

    
### Try-Except with Finally Block
Code in the finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred.

Syntax: 
      try: # Code that might raise an exception except 
      ExceptionType: # Code to handle the exception 
      finally: # Code that always executes 

Code:
    try: 
        file = open("data.txt", "r") 
        data = file.read() 
    except FileNotFoundError: 
        print("File not found.") 
    finally: 
        file.close()

  ### While Loop
A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains True.

Syntax: while condition: # Code to repeat 
Code:
  count = 0 
  while count < 5:
      print(count)
      count += 1
